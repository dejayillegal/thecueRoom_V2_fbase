# Agent Instructions

- Use Node.js **20.19.5** via `.nvmrc`.
- Prefer `npm@10` workspaces; run `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build` from the repo root before committing.
- Format code with Prettier and keep TypeScript strict.
- Do not commit secrets; store them in environment files documented in `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`.
- Review the docs in `docs/` for project conventions before making changes.
